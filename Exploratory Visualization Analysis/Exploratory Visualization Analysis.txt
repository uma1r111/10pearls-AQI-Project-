Exploratory Visualisation Analysis:

1) Strong Positive Correlations with AQI (aqi_us):

- scaled_log_pm2_5 (0.66) and scaled_log_pm10 (0.64) show the strongest positive correlations
with aqi_us. This indicates that PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter) are major drivers 
of air quality degradation in Karachi, consistent with AQI calculations where PM 
is often a key factor.

- scaled_log_co (0.17) and scaled_log_no2 (0.12) also have weak positive correlations, 
suggesting carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide contribute to higher AQI values, 
likely from traffic or industrial sources.

- scaled_o3 (0.10) has a minor positive correlation, indicating ozone plays a smaller
role in the observed AQI.
